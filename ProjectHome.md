This project was created for educational and experimental purposes.

This n-puzzle has two main objectives:

1 - To find some solutions for a classic AI problem, the N Puzzle.
2 - To try out some Java RIA framework.

For this actual version 1.1, I used the A`*` Pathfinding, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing solutions. I used the [Encog](http://code.google.com/p/encog-java/) framework, the GA and SA implementations.

On the RIA side, I used [Apache Pivot](http://pivot.apache.org/), and have a good result with it :).

I also used [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as build tool, so if you try to compile it from the code, you'll have to download it.

I've also have open sourced another educational project based on the [TSP](http://routingways.googlecode.com) problem, so check it out if you got interest :)
